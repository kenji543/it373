The setup of Python and Django proved to be much easier than I expected. The steps involved were less complicated than those of setting up other applications or games, where I usually struggle.

The use of the terminal or PowerShell also made everything easier, for you only needed to be familiar with the commands in order to perform whatever actions you wanted. This also proved to be the opposite of what I expected, because the thought of using the command line interface initially gave me a feeling of confusion. But as I got familiar, it proved to be simpler and more direct compared to the GUI.

I struggled the most with committing and pushing my files to GitHub itself because I didnâ€™t know what the commands meant; I just followed the documentation. Therefore, I had problems where I got confused with the commands and mistakenly uploaded files into different repositories.

Overall, the learning experience I got is enormous because it changed my perception of the terminal, which I used to think was obsolete and complicated.
